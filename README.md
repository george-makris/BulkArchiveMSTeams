# Bulk archive teams
---
# Background
---
For the time being in the Teams admin center, there is not way to filter out or batch select teams by archival state. Due to the demand by some administrators to be able to bulk archive the teams of choice and their respective SharePoint sites, this script was create to cover that demand until this functionality is added in the teams admin center.
